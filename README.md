# 🏥 Hospital Management System (C++ OOP + DSA)

This project is a comprehensive **Hospital Management System** built using **C++**, applying core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** concepts. It simulates a multi-functional hospital environment with features for patient management, staff and doctors, real-time alerting, inventory, appointments, billing, and disease detection.
